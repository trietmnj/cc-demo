## Workflow

### 1. Clone the SDK

Clone `cc-py-sdk` from USACE into the **same parent directory** as this repo. This allows you to develop both the SDK and plugin in tandem.

```graphql
parent-folder/
â”œâ”€â”€ cc-demo/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plugin/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ cc-py-sdk/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cc/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plugin_manager.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USACE/cc-py-sdk
````

---

### 2. Make `compose.sh` Executable
```bash
chmod u+x compose.sh
```

---

### 3. Start Local Infrastructure
```bash
./compose.sh infras-up
```

---

### 4. Develop Your Plugin

- Develop your plugin in the `plugin/` directory.
- Optionally modify the SDK in `../cc-py-sdk/src/cc`.
- The plugin's entry point must be: `plugin/main.py`.
- The payload can be updated in `seed/payloads/payload`

---

### 5. Test the Plugin

**Run the plugin container:**

```bash
./compose.sh plugin-up
```

### (Optional) 5a. Connect VSCode to the container

Start the plugin container in interactive mode

```bash
./compose.sh plugin-it-up
```

Then connect to the container using VSCode

```plaintext
> Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container...
> /cc-plugin
```
